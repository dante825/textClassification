\section{Introduction}
This section would illustrate the process flow of how to carry out the experiments to fulfil the aforementioned objectives.

First, the news articles must undergo preprocessing. The preprocessing includes converting all the words to lowercase, numbers and punctuations removal, stop words removal, stemming and others. 

After preprocessing, TF-IDF algorithm would be applied on the text to extract the features from the text. The resulting vector space from TF-IDF would be undergo a dimension reduction algorithm.

After vector space model dimension is reduced, the vector space model is used to train a machine learning algorithm. The trained machine learning model is validated and tested and its performance is evaluated.

The vector space model of the news articles from TF-IDF can undergo different dimension reduction algorithm or none at all. The classification accuracy stemming from this differences would be compared. 

The machine learning algorithms use to train the models would be the few document classification machine learning algorithms chosen in chapter 2, namely SVM, kNN and Neural Network.

\section{Conclusion}
With the method mentioned above, the experiments would be carry out and the results would be recorded. The results would be compared and the differences would be analysed.
